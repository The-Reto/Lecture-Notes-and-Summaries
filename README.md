# Lecture Notes and Summaries
Collection of notes I took during lectures or summaries I've written on lectures for exam preparation. Both from my Bachelors degree in Computational Sciences (Major Physics) at University of Basel as well as from my Masters degree in Physics at ETH ZÃ¼rich (the latter one is ongoing). Not all courses are equally important and not all lecture styles are suitable for simultaneous LaTex note taking, therefore only a fraction of all courses are represented here. The notes and summaries are in the language the course was held in, this may be German or English.

The documents that are notes were typed **during** the lectures, while the professors speak or write at the blackboard. In these cases speed is more important than content and both are *much* more important than spelling or layout.

### Disclaimer
All of the documents provided here contain a lot of errors of various nature and severity. Especially the ones written as notes during the lectures contain many errors, typos etc.

Spelling isn't my strong suit, so even the more carefully and slowly written summaries contain a lot of spelling mistakes - the quickly written notes contain even more of them.
